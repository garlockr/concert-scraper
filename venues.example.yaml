# Concert Scraper Configuration
# Copy this to venues.yaml and customize with your local venues

# Name of the calendar to create/use
calendar_name: "Local Concerts"

# Calendar backend: "auto" (detect platform), "applescript" (macOS), "caldav" (iCloud/cross-platform), "ics" (file export only)
# "auto" will use AppleScript on macOS, ICS file export on Linux/other
calendar_backend: "auto"

# CalDAV settings (only used if calendar_backend is "caldav")
# For iCloud: generate an app-specific password at https://appleid.apple.com
caldav:
  url: "https://caldav.icloud.com"
  username: "your-apple-id@icloud.com"
  password: "your-app-specific-password"

# ICS export settings (only used if calendar_backend is "ics" or "auto" on Linux)
ics_output_dir: "output/"

# LLM backend: "anthropic" (default, requires API key) or "ollama" (free, local, optional)
llm_backend: "anthropic"

# Anthropic settings (used when llm_backend is "anthropic")
# Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var before running.
# Cost: ~$0.05/run for 20 venues (~$2.50/year on weekly schedule)
# Model options by cost (cheapest first):
#   - "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001" -- cheapest, ~$0.25/M input tokens, excellent for extraction
#   - "claude-sonnet-4-6" -- better quality, ~10x cost of Haiku
anthropic:
  model: "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"

# Ollama settings (only used if llm_backend is "ollama")
# Requires Ollama installed and running locally -- see https://ollama.com
# Recommended models (in order of quality vs. resource tradeoff):
#   - "llama3.1" -- good balance, runs on 8GB RAM
#   - "qwen2.5:14b" -- excellent at structured extraction, needs 16GB RAM
ollama:
  model: "llama3.1"
  base_url: "http://localhost:11434"

# Database path for deduplication tracking
db_path: "data/events.db"

# Seconds to wait between scraping each venue (be polite)
request_delay: 2

# Default event duration in hours (when end time is unknown)
default_event_duration_hours: 3

# Venues to scrape
# Each venue needs:
#   - name: Human-readable venue name
#   - url: URL of their events/calendar page
#   - location: Street address (used in calendar events)
#   - requires_browser: (optional) Set to true for JS-heavy sites. Requires `pip install concert-scraper[browser]`
